Option 1: The "Candid Startup" Vibe

Prompt: A high-angle, candid shot of two young tech professionals sitting at a messy, wooden shared desk in a sunlit, loft-style office. They are looking at a sleek laptop screen showing a minimalist SaaS dashboard with purple and blue accents. There are coffee mugs, a small potted plant, and a notebook on the table. The lighting is warm and natural, coming from a large window. Soft focus background, authentic atmosphere, high-quality lifestyle photography, shot on 35mm lens.

Option 2: The "Creative Focus" Vibe

Prompt: A close-up, over-the-shoulder shot of a person wearing a casual hoodie, working on a clean digital interface on a large high-resolution monitor. The UI has a dark mode aesthetic with vibrant data visualizations. The background is a blurred modern co-working space with warm pendant lights and greenery. Shallow depth of field, cinematic lighting, ultra-realistic textures, professional tech-creative aesthetic.

Option 3: The "Collaborative Energy" Vibe

Prompt: A wide shot of a small, diverse team of three people in a casual modern office space. One person is pointing at a monitor displaying a sleek business platform, while the others are engaged in a relaxed conversation. The office has exposed brick walls, comfortable seating, and a large whiteboard in the background. The mood is energetic and creative, avoiding corporate cliches. Natural daylight, vibrant but realistic colors, shot on a Sony A7R IV.
