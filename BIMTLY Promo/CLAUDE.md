## About BIMTLY

### Mission
**Bridge the gap between physical products/assets and their digital information.**

Every company with physical products or assets struggles with the same problem: information is SCATTERED, INACCESSIBLE, and DISCONNECTED from the physical things it describes—files in Dropbox, data in spreadsheets, designs in Figma, 3D in SketchUp, feedback in email, specs in PDFs.

BIMTLY creates a **unified digital layer** for physical world management.

### The Platform: Five Pillars
| Pillar | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Drive** | Cloud file management for any digital asset |
| **Data Builder** | Structured data collections (smart spreadsheets that connect to everything) |
| **Web Builder** | No-code website/portal builder with live data binding |
| **3D Studio** | Browser-based 3D visualization with professional tools |
| **Doc Editor** | View, annotate, and mark up images, PDFs, 3D models |

### Core Value Proposition
- **Products** → Easier to **SELL**
- **Assets** → Easier to **MANAGE**
- **Projects** → Easier to **DOCUMENT**

### Platform Overview (Key Slide)
**BIMTLY Platform** — An all-in-one online platform combining a centralized knowledge base, immersive 3D visualization, and seamless presentation of your entire product range.

Designed to connect your online catalog, technical documentation and sales channels for a streamlined customer experience and enhanced business efficiency.

**6 Core Modules (hub diagram):**
| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **3D Studio** | Create and manage interactive 3D and AR designs, including 3D configurators |
| **Parts Catalogs** | Organize and display products and design systems |
| **Support and Training Center** | Centralized platform for user guides, tutorials, and assistance |
| **Website Builder** | Design, build, and publish websites with minimal effort |
| **E-Commerce** | Set up and operate an online store with payment processing |
| **Quotation System** | Generate detailed and accurate quotes for products and services |

*This is the most important slide in the pitch deck — it shows BIMTLY as the central hub connecting all business functions.*

### Old Way vs NEW WAY (Transformation Slide)
**Visual before/after comparison:**

| Old Way | NEW WAY |
|---------|---------|
| Scattered technical drawings & documents | Organized file grid with thumbnails |
| PDFs everywhere | Structured hierarchy/tree view |
| Excel spreadsheets | Connected data |
| Phone calls & missed notifications | |
| Chat apps & email threads | |
| Support staff juggling communications | Clean BIMTLY interface with 3D viewer |

**Key visual elements:**
- Left: Chaotic collage of documents with overwhelmed support person
- Right: Clean BIMTLY UI showing organized assets + 3D product visualization (door/window "Termo 65")

*This slide powerfully communicates the transformation — from chaos to clarity.*

### Cloud Collaboration Platform (User Personas Slide)
**Tagline:** "BIMTLY - Cloud collaboration platform"

**Three user personas connected through BIMTLY:**

| Persona | Role Types |
|---------|------------|
| **Operations** | Manufacturers, Field workers |
| **Technical** | Architects, CAD/BIM Specialists |
| **Leadership** | Decision makers, Investors, Managers |

**BIMTLY services bridging all personas:**
- Set up
- Tips and solutions
- Tech support
- Onboarding

*This slide shows BIMTLY as the central hub connecting different stakeholders — from field workers to executives — enabling seamless collaboration.*

### Enhances Digital Connectivity (Integration Slide)
**Tagline:** "3000+ tools and platforms"

**Inputs → BIMTLY Platform → Outputs**

| Content IN | Connects TO |
|------------|-------------|
| CAD drawings | PLM |
| 3D models | E-mail and chat |
| Vector Graphics | Productivity tools |
| Images | E-comm platforms |
| Text | Whiteboard tools |
| Create from scratch | Presentations |
| | Social Media |
| | CMS |

**Visual elements:**
- Center: BIMTLY interface with product grid + 3D architectural visualization
- Right: Screenshots of connected tools (Slack, Notion, SAP, etc.)

*This slide positions BIMTLY as the central hub that ingests all your content types and connects to the tools your team already uses.*

### Traditional Solutions Pain Points (Problem Slide)
**Title:** "Traditional Solutions: Moving Beyond Outdated Approaches"

**Key Pain Points:**
- Limited to Static File Downloads
- No Online Viewer for Instant Access
- Disconnected and Non-Integrated Workflow
- BIM Files Accessible Only with Specialized Tools (e.g., Revit)

**Visual proof of the problem:**
- Old file browser with deeply nested folder structures
- Complex file organization (DWG, PDF, multiple language catalogs)
- Static BIM documentation pages
- Contrast with BIMTLY's clean "Termo 65" product viewer

*This slide establishes the industry pain before showing BIMTLY's solution.*

## Key Differentiators

### vs. Custom Development
- €50-500/month vs. €50k-100k+ for custom solutions
- Live in weeks, not years
- No developer dependency

### vs. Point Solutions (Sketchfab, Threekit, Akeneo)
- **BIMTLY edge:** PIM + 3D + Web in ONE unified platform
- Others are 3D-only or PIM-only—never connected

### vs. Enterprise (Procore, BIM 360, IBM Maximo)
- Simpler, more affordable
- Built for mid-market (20-500 employees)
- No enterprise complexity

### The Positioning Line
> "Spline and Vectary are great for designers creating 3D visuals. BIMTLY is built for companies selling complex physical products. We handle configuration, pricing, documentation—all connected."

## Competitive Talking Points

| When they say... | Respond with... |
|------------------|-----------------|
| "We already have a solution" | "Is everything connected, or are there manual steps between your 3D, data, and website? That's the gap we close." |
| "Too expensive" | "Custom development costs 5-10x more. What's the cost of your current manual processes—in hours, in lost deals?" |
| "We'll build it ourselves" | "Is building product visualization software your core competency? What happens when that developer leaves?" |

## Design Principles for Promo Materials

1. **Visual hierarchy** — Guide the eye: large headlines → supporting text → details
2. **Whitespace** — Let elements breathe, avoid clutter
3. **The 3-second test** — Key message visible at a glance
4. **Show, don't tell** — Screenshots, diagrams, workflows over text walls
5. **Print-ready** — A4 format (210x297mm), colors work in print
6. **Consistent rhythm** — Reuse spacing, component patterns

## When Creating Materials

### Do:
- Focus on **outcomes** (faster quotes, fewer lost deals) not features
- Use real scenarios (window manufacturer, hospital facility, construction site)
- Show the **before/after** transformation
- Keep text scannable—bullets over paragraphs
- Test PDF output frequently with `npm run build:pdf`

### Don't:
- Make time estimates or promises
- Use generic tech buzzwords
- Cram too much information—less is more
- Forget mobile/tablet views for digital materials
