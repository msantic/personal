BIMTLY
Unified Visual & Prompt System

(Internal brand + AI generation guide)

You can literally drop this into Notion / Google Docs as-is.

PART 1 — BIMTLY CORE VISUAL MANIFESTO (1-page)
The BIMTLY Visual Truth

BIMTLY visualizes clarity in complex physical systems.

Everything we generate must feel:

grounded in reality

calm under complexity

built for professionals, not hype

We are not selling software.
We are selling control over physical complexity.

Brand Energy
Axis	Where BIMTLY Lives
Loud ← → Quiet	Quiet confidence
Abstract ← → Concrete	Concrete, real-world
Flashy ← → Useful	Useful, functional
Marketing ← → Documentary	Documentary

If an image feels like marketing → ❌
If it feels like real work → ✅

Human Role

Humans are:

users, not models

thinking, not posing

collaborating, not performing

The product is always the hero.
Humans give scale, trust, and context.

Visual Rule of Three

Every BIMTLY image should clearly show at least 2 of 3:

People (professional, focused)

Product (screens, 3D, data)

Physical context (materials, space, industry)

If it shows only 1 → too abstract.

PART 2 — GLOBAL PROMPT BASE (ALWAYS INCLUDED)

This block goes into every prompt, always.

Candid, documentary-style photography. Calm, confident professionals working with real digital tools to manage complex physical products or assets. Modern industrial workspace, natural daylight, exposed materials, neutral color palette. The mood is focused, human, and quietly powerful—technical but approachable. No corporate clichés, no staged poses, no hype.

You build everything on top of this.

PART 3 — PROMPT PACKS BY USE CASE
A) WEBSITE HERO IMAGES
Hero Prompt 01 — “Control the Complexity”

A wide, calm shot of professionals in a modern industrial workspace reviewing a complex physical product through a 3D interface on a large screen. One person points at a detailed model while others discuss options. The interface shows structured data, parts, and configuration logic. Natural daylight, exposed brick and concrete, neutral tones, realistic materials. Documentary-style, confident, composed.

Use for:
Homepage hero, platform overview

Hero Prompt 02 — “From Physical to Digital”

A professional workspace where physical product samples sit on a table next to a screen displaying their digital twin in a structured 3D interface. People are calmly discussing how physical components connect to digital data. Muted colors, industrial textures, natural light, editorial photography style.

Use for:
Vision pages, “What is BIMTLY?”

B) PRODUCT / FEATURE PAGES
3D Studio Feature

A focused moment showing a professional using a browser-based 3D editor to inspect a real industrial component. Cross-sections, measurements, and data panels are visible on screen. The environment is calm and modern, with natural daylight and minimal distractions. The person is concentrated, not posing.

Data Builder / Structured Data

A professional reviewing structured product data connected to a 3D model on a large monitor. Tables, attributes, and linked assets are visible. The space feels architectural and organized. The mood is clarity, order, and control.

Web Builder / Publishing

A calm collaborative moment where professionals review a published product portal on screen—showing interactive 3D, pricing, and documentation. The focus is on how data becomes presentation. Documentary style, neutral palette.

C) SALES & PITCH DECK VISUALS
Sales Slide — “Old Way vs New Way”

A subtle contrast scene: one side shows printed drawings and scattered documents on a table, the other shows a single screen with a clean, connected 3D platform. Professionals naturally gravitate toward the digital solution. No dramatization, calm realism.

Decision Maker Focus

A composed professional reviewing a complex product configuration on a screen, alone or with one colleague. The mood is thoughtful and decisive. The environment feels executive but practical—no luxury, no corporate flash.

D) SOCIAL / CONTENT MARKETING
Behind-the-Scenes

A candid behind-the-scenes moment of professionals discussing product data and 3D models in a relaxed industrial workspace. Coffee cups, sketches, screens visible. Feels real, unstaged, human.

Thought Leadership Visual

A calm workspace with a professional reviewing a complex digital model alone. Quiet focus, no interaction. Emphasizes expertise and depth.

PART 6 — ONE-LINE INTERNAL CHECK

Before approving any image:

Does this look like something a serious manufacturer, architect, or facility manager would trust?

If yes → ship it
If no → regenerate
