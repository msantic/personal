# BIMTLY Visual Manifesto

**Unified Visual & Prompt System** — Internal brand + AI generation guide

---

## Part 1: Core Visual Manifesto

### The BIMTLY Visual Truth

> BIMTLY visualizes clarity in complex physical systems.

Everything we generate must feel:
- Grounded in reality
- Calm under complexity
- Built for professionals, not hype

**We are not selling software. We are selling control over physical complexity.**

### Brand Energy

| Axis | Where BIMTLY Lives |
|------|-------------------|
| Loud ← → Quiet | Quiet confidence |
| Abstract ← → Concrete | Concrete, real-world |
| Flashy ← → Useful | Useful, functional |
| Marketing ← → Documentary | Documentary |

- If an image feels like marketing → **NO**
- If it feels like real work → **YES**

### Human Role

Humans are:
- Users, not models
- Thinking, not posing
- Collaborating, not performing

**The product is always the hero.** Humans give scale, trust, and context.

### Visual Rule of Three

Every BIMTLY image should clearly show at least 2 of 3:

1. **People** — professional, focused
2. **Product** — screens, 3D, data
3. **Physical context** — materials, space, industry

If it shows only 1 → too abstract.

## Part 2: Global Prompt Base

**Always include this block in every prompt:**

```
Candid, documentary-style photography. Calm, confident professionals working
with real digital tools to manage complex physical products or assets. Modern
industrial workspace, natural daylight, exposed materials, neutral color palette.
The mood is focused, human, and quietly powerful—technical but approachable.
No corporate clichés, no staged poses, no hype.
```

Build everything on top of this.

## Part 3: Prompt Packs by Use Case

### A) Website Hero Images

#### Hero 01 — "Control the Complexity"

```
A wide, calm shot of professionals in a modern industrial workspace reviewing
a complex physical product through a 3D interface on a large screen. One person
points at a detailed model while others discuss options. The interface shows
structured data, parts, and configuration logic. Natural daylight, exposed brick
and concrete, neutral tones, realistic materials. Documentary-style, confident, composed.
```

**Use for:** Homepage hero, platform overview

#### Hero 02 — "From Physical to Digital"

```
A professional workspace where physical product samples sit on a table next to
a screen displaying their digital twin in a structured 3D interface. People are
calmly discussing how physical components connect to digital data. Muted colors,
industrial textures, natural light, editorial photography style.
```

**Use for:** Vision pages, "What is BIMTLY?"

### B) Product / Feature Pages

#### 3D Studio Feature

```
A focused moment showing a professional using a browser-based 3D editor to inspect
a real industrial component. Cross-sections, measurements, and data panels are
visible on screen. The environment is calm and modern, with natural daylight and
minimal distractions. The person is concentrated, not posing.
```

#### Data Builder / Structured Data

```
A professional reviewing structured product data connected to a 3D model on a
large monitor. Tables, attributes, and linked assets are visible. The space feels
architectural and organized. The mood is clarity, order, and control.
```

#### Web Builder / Publishing

```
A calm collaborative moment where professionals review a published product portal
on screen—showing interactive 3D, pricing, and documentation. The focus is on how
data becomes presentation. Documentary style, neutral palette.
```

### C) Sales & Pitch Deck Visuals

#### "Old Way vs New Way"

```
A subtle contrast scene: one side shows printed drawings and scattered documents
on a table, the other shows a single screen with a clean, connected 3D platform.
Professionals naturally gravitate toward the digital solution. No dramatization,
calm realism.
```

#### Decision Maker Focus

```
A composed professional reviewing a complex product configuration on a screen,
alone or with one colleague. The mood is thoughtful and decisive. The environment
feels executive but practical—no luxury, no corporate flash.
```

### D) Social / Content Marketing

#### Behind-the-Scenes

```
A candid behind-the-scenes moment of professionals discussing product data and
3D models in a relaxed industrial workspace. Coffee cups, sketches, screens visible.
Feels real, unstaged, human.
```

#### Thought Leadership Visual

```
A calm workspace with a professional reviewing a complex digital model alone.
Quiet focus, no interaction. Emphasizes expertise and depth.
```

- If yes → ship it
- If no → regenerate
