# BIMTLY Sales Playbook +Competitive Positioning & Vertical Segmentation

# BIMTLY Sales Playbook v1.0

---

## 1. Executive Summary

BIMTLY is a cloud-based platform that bridges the physical and digital worlds by enabling companies to create, manage, and showcase their products and assets in interactive 3D. This playbook is designed for a lean, one-person sales team to systematically identify, engage, and convert early adopters using a **14-day free trial** as the primary hook. The goal is to validate product-market fit across three verticals (Product Visualization, Asset Management, Construction) while generating case studies and inbound momentum.

---

## 2. Unique Selling Propositions (USPs)

Based on the provided materials, BIMTLY’s core differentiators are:

**All-in-One Platform:** Unlike point solutions (PIM-only, 3D-only, or web-only), BIMTLY combines:

- Product Information Management (Data Builder)
- Interactive 3D Configurators (3D Studio)
- No-Code Web Building (Web Builder)
- Document & Annotation Tools (Doc Editor)
- Cloud File Management (Drive)

**Real-Time Data Binding:** Change a product’s price or spec once—it updates everywhere instantly (website, 3D viewer, quotes).

**Built for Non-Tech Users:** No-code/low-code philosophy enables marketing, sales, and operations teams to build without IT.

**BIM Heritage, Broad Application:** Inspired by Building Information Modeling but extended to any physical product or asset system.

**Cost-Effective vs. Custom Development:** SaaS model at €50–500/month vs. €50k–100k+ for custom-built solutions.

---

## 3. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

Given the three market directions, we will start with **Product Visualization & Sales** as the primary focus (highest traction, clear ROI). Secondary focus: **Asset Management**.

### Primary ICP (Product Visualization):

**Industry:** Manufacturing (windows, doors, facades, furniture, industrial equipment, modular building, commercial refrigeration).

**Company Size:** 20–500 employees.

**Role:** Marketing Director, Sales Director, Digital/E-commerce Manager.

**Pain Points:**

- Static PDF catalogs that are outdated and hard to update.
- Slow quote turnaround (days vs. minutes).
- Sales reps acting as “catalog lookup services.”
- Lost deals due to poor online experience.
- Disconnected systems (PIM, 3D, website, CRM/ERP).

### Secondary ICP (Asset Management):

**Industry:** Facility Management, Property Management, Manufacturing Plants, Healthcare, Municipalities.

**Role:** Facility Manager, Operations Director, CFO.

**Pain Points:**

- Asset data in spreadsheets or legacy CMMS.
- Manual maintenance tracking.
- Inability to locate equipment manuals or history quickly.
- No visual (3D/floor plan) context for assets.

---

## 4. Sales Process Overview

Prospecting → Use [**Apollo.io**](http://apollo.io/) to build targeted lists by industry, role, and pain point.

Outreach → 3-step email sequence + LinkedIn touch.

Qualification → Use discovery calls to confirm ICP fit and pain.

Trial Activation → Invite to 14-day free trial with onboarding support.

Use Case Co-Creation → Work with the customer to build a mini-project (e.g., one product configurator).

Case Study & Conversion → Document results, ask for testimonial, convert to paid plan.

---

## 5. Prospecting Strategy

### Tools:

- [Apollo.io](http://apollo.io/) (paid) for contact scraping, email sequencing, and LinkedIn outreach.
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (optional later) for advanced filtering.

### Lists to Build in Apollo:

- Manufacturing Companies (keywords: “window manufacturer,” “door systems,” “facade engineering,” “furniture company”).
- Roles: “Marketing Director,” “Head of Sales,” “Digital Manager.”
- Geos: Start with DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) and EU.
- Company Size: 20–500 employees.

# 📞 EXPANDED DISCOVERY QUESTIONS

---

## Manufacturing Vertical:

### Current State:

- "Walk me through how a customer configures and orders your product today."
- "Where do your 3D models, spec sheets, and pricing tables live right now?"
- "How many different systems does sales use to generate a quote?"

### Pain Points:

1. "When a product price changes, how many places need updating?"
2. "How often do customers ask for visuals or details you can't easily provide?"
3. "What's the most time-consuming part of your sales process?"

### Impact:

1. "If you could cut quote time in half, how many more deals could your team handle?"
2. "How much time weekly is spent manually updating product information?"

---

## Asset Management Vertical:

### Current State:

- "How do technicians currently access equipment manuals or maintenance history?"
- "Where are your asset records stored (spreadsheets, folders, other software)?"
- "How do you track equipment locations across facilities?"

### Pain Points:

1. "When equipment fails, how long does it take to find all relevant documentation?"
2. "How do you ensure compliance documentation is audit-ready?"
3. "What's your biggest frustration during equipment inspections?"

### Impact:

1. "If you could reduce equipment downtime by 20%, what would that save annually?"
2. "How many hours weekly are spent searching for asset information?"

---

## Construction Vertical:

### Current State:

- "How do site teams document issues or progress today?"

2. "How much time is spent weekly compiling progress reports?"

---

# 🎯 COMPETITIVE TALKING POINTS

---

### When They Mention Spline / Vectary:

"Spline and Vectary are great for designers creating 3D visuals. BIMTLY is built for manufacturers selling complex physical products. We handle product configuration with engineering rules, real-time pricing, ERP integration, and technical documentation—all things design tools don't address."

---

### When Price is Objection:

"Custom development for a product configurator starts at $50K+. Spline/Vectary give you visuals but no sales functionality. BIMTLY gives you both, starting at [price]. Plus, we handle implementation so you're live in weeks, not months."

---

### When They Want "Just 3D":

"You can get 3D visuals anywhere. What manufacturers really need is **3D that sells**. That means connecting visuals to pricing, inventory, documentation, and sales channels. That's what we built."
