## BIMTLY Customer Journey

**The core flow our videos should communicate:**

```
Show → Configure → Quote → Sell
```

| Stage | What Happens | BIMTLY Enables |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Show** | Customer browses products, views 3D models | E-Catalogues, 3D Visualization |
| **Configure** | Customer customizes options, sees changes live | Interactive Configurators |
| **Quote** | Instant pricing, generate PDF quotes | CPQ (Configure-Price-Quote) |
| **Sell** | Complete purchase, data flows to ERP | Ecommerce, Integrations |

This journey should be the backbone of every marketing video.


## MY INIT INPUT ZA JACI FOKUS I KOMUNIKACIJU

3D Visualization = the front-end experience layer (why you’re different)

E-Catalogues = the publishing + distribution layer (how it gets to buyers/channels)

CPQ = the “complexity engine” (how buyers configure + you price + you quote)

E-commerce = the transaction layer (how money/orders happen)


## ITERACIJA
Instead of “4 offerings”, present as one platform with modules:

BIMTLY Studio
3D visualization, product scenes, interactive viewer, AR/VR-ready

BIMTLY Configure (CPQ)
Rules, options, constraints, pricing, BOM output, quote generation

BIMTLY Publish (E-Catalogues)
Digital catalogs, embeds, share links, channel exports, multi-language

BIMTLY Commerce (optional)
Checkout / orders / payments or integrations (Shopify, Woo, SAP/ERP)



## 1.  VERZIJA

3D Product Experience Interactive 3D experiences that help customers understand products and decide faster. 

Configure Configure & Quote (CPQ) Rules-based configuration with instant, accurate pricing and quotations.

What kind of company BIMTLY is
The clearest, most defensible definition

BIMTLY is a product sales platform for companies that sell complex physical products.

That’s the core truth. Everything else is detail.

If you want it one level richer (homepage / pitch deck ready):

BIMTLY is a visual product sales platform that helps manufacturers show, configure, quote, and sell complex products digitally.

## Industry Best Practices

### The 3-Act Formula

**Act 1: Hook (0-5s)**
- Capture attention immediately
- Start with pain point OR "wow" moment
- No logos, no text walls
- Motion from frame 1

**Act 2: Show Value (5-25s)**
- Product in action, not features list
- Real use cases, not abstract concepts
- Before/after or transformation
- Speed and fluidity

**Act 3: CTA (last 3-5s)**
- Single clear action
- Logo resolve
- Tagline optional

---

## Top Industry Patterns

### 1. Product-in-Context
Show product being used naturally in real workflow.
- **Example:** Figma showing designers collaborating
- **Best for:** SaaS, tools, platforms

### 2. Problem → Solution
Quick pain montage → smooth resolution with product.
- **Example:** Monday.com chaos → organized boards
- **Best for:** Productivity, management tools

### 3. Transformation/Before-After
Static old way → Dynamic new way.
- **Example:** PDF catalog → Interactive 3D configurator
- **Best for:** BIMTLY use case

### 4. Speed Demo
Hyperlapse of complex task done in seconds.
- **Example:** Webflow building site in 60s
- **Best for:** No-code, builders

### 5. Social Proof Montage
Quick cuts of real customers/brands using product.
- **Example:** Logos, screenshots, testimonials
- **Best for:** Established products

### 6. Cinematic Product Shots
Apple-style close-ups with depth of field, UI floating in 3D space.
- **Best for:** Premium positioning

---

## What to Avoid

- ❌ Starting with logo (boring, skip-worthy)
- ❌ Feature lists as text overlays
- ❌ Stock footage that doesn't match product
- ❌ Voiceover explaining obvious UI actions
- ❌ More than 2 fonts
- ❌ Slow fade-ins (attention lost in 2s)
- ❌ Music-dependent storytelling (muted autoplay)

- Create powerful product experiences
- Showcase without limits
