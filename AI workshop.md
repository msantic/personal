## AI Workshop

- Disclaimer
    - I’m not an expert just using 10h a day…
- Current status of the Team on using AI
    - what AI models, IDE, plugins (Copilot, Claude Code etc.)
- Intro
    - Promjena paradigme
    - Postajemo supervizori
    - Omogucuje da se fokusiramo na high level arhitekturu
    - Znacajno smanjuje mentalni zamor
    - I dalje ima skeptika ali AI je vec pobjedio, treba uzeti najbolje iz dva svijeta i prilagoditi se
        - nema sanse vise da konkuriramo brzini, akum. znanju, ...
        - trebamo imati jasnu viziju ali ostaviti otvoren boljoj arhit.
            - razni patterni
            - naming
            - ostatak codebase
            - puno
- Agenti
- Copilot vs Claude Code
    - Main diffs
    - Planning mode
    - Pricing
    - VS Code plugins diff
    - Copilot
        - Pros
            - Accept vs Revert changes
            - DnD Images
            - Better integration with VS Code
            - Native voice-to-text
        - Cons
            - No planning/no native Claude planning
    - Claude Code
        - Pros
            - Native Planning !!!
            - Far superior coding model, latest Opus 4.5 !!!
            - Powerful CLI
                - can you system notifications
        - Cons
            - Weaker integration
            - No DnD images, needs workarounds, c&p image
            - No native voice-to-text, can use native OS
- Setup
    - [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md)
    - permissions, .claude/settings.local.json
    - Custom PROMPTS.md
    - Skills
        - debuglogs
        - inline docs
        - debug db
        - …
- Importance of ./docs and to keep thing documented with arch. tech. details and design decisions
- NAJBITNIJE Feedback loop
    - debug panel for easy cp
    - staviti u [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) pozive na sve test procedure
    - test procedure moraju imati podrsku za filter, e.g. samo poziv jednog file
    - dedicated debug logs system on platform level, client and server side
      - the idea is to speed up fetching and re-feeding the prompt with the logs
- What to be aware of
    - What model, i always use the latest and most powerful, seems slow for easy task but overall you save time since there is less errors and fighting it
    - Run 2-3 agents in parallel to speed up development
        - I wouldn’t go over that because of mental overload, we are bottleneck (code review, testing) not AI
    - Divide a big feature into smaller tasks
    - Using with Notion, planning and writing tasks,
    - when writing propmpts important to give context and as much as possible precise instructions
      - it doesn't always perform as expected, there are always frustrating actions
        - git commit/checkout/resetting working drafts
        - ignoring skills commands, e.g. debugLogs and using console.logs instead
    - its fine to use broken english and shortcuts to speed up prompts
      - but dictating is in average 3-4x faster specially for longer prompts
    - you can literally give everything to AI, even its own instructions, config, writing prompts for the next prompt
    - the key is to automate process pipeline as much as possible
    - cp ready and context aware planning
    - Group task logically in project mngt./planning software, like Trello, Notion
      - SHOW my Notion org
    
    - GIT commit message rules
    - I read most of the generated code or main key decisions, file organization
        - but not black box algorithms, for them i make vitest, e2e api test
- Present most complex things AI did
    - Entire NoCode DataBuilder with multiple layouts, views and filters
