## AI Workshop

- Disclaimer
    - I'm not an expert, just using it 10h a day, so these are my best practices
        - As a non-deterministic system, there is no single best way — you need to adapt it to your process
- Input: Team's current AI usage
    - What AI models, IDEs, plugins (Copilot, Claude Code, etc.)
- Intro
    - Paradigm shift
    - We're becoming supervisors
    - Allows us to focus on high-level architecture
    - Significantly reduces mental fatigue
    - There are still skeptics, but AI has already won — we need to take the best from both worlds and adapt
        - There's no way we can compete with its speed, accumulated knowledge, etc.
        - We need to have a clear vision but stay open to better architecture
            - Various patterns
            - Naming conventions
            - Consistency with the rest of the codebase
            - And much more
    - Good & bad: the field moves incredibly fast — if you don't follow for just 1-2 months, you're already behind
- Agents
- Copilot vs Claude Code
    - Main differences
    - Planning mode
    - Pricing
    - VS Code plugin differences
    - Copilot
        - Pros
            - Accept vs Revert changes
            - Drag & drop images
            - Better integration with VS Code
            - Native voice-to-text
        - Cons
            - No planning / no native Claude planning
    - Claude Code
        - Pros
            - Native planning !!!
            - Far superior coding model, latest Opus 4.5 !!!
            - Powerful CLI
                - Can use system notifications
        - Cons
            - Weaker integration
            - No drag & drop images, needs workarounds (copy & paste image)
            - No native voice-to-text, can use native OS
- Setup
    - [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md)
    - Permissions, .claude/settings.local.json
    - Custom PROMPTS.md
    - Skills
        - debugLogs
        - inline docs
        - debug db
        - …
- Importance of ./docs — keep things documented with architectural details, technical specs, and design decisions
- MOST IMPORTANT: Feedback loop
    - Debug panel for easy copy-paste
    - Put calls to all test procedures in [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md)
    - Test procedures must support filtering, e.g., running only one file
    - Dedicated debug logs system at platform level, client and server side
        - The idea is to speed up fetching and re-feeding the prompt with the logs
- Example of how I assign a task
- What to be aware of
    - Model choice: I always use the latest and most powerful. It may seem slow&overkill for simple tasks, but overall you save time since there are fewer errors and less back-and-forth
    - Run 2-3 agents in parallel to speed up development
        - I wouldn't go over that because of mental overload — we are the bottleneck (code review, testing), not AI
    - Divide big features into smaller tasks
    - Use Notion for planning and writing tasks
    - When writing prompts, it's important to give context and provide instructions as precisely as possible
        - It doesn't always perform as expected; there are always frustrating behaviors
            - Git commit/checkout/resetting working drafts
            - Ignoring skill commands, e.g., debugLogs, and using console.logs instead
    - It's fine to use broken English and shortcuts to speed up prompts
        - But dictating is on average 3-4x faster, especially for longer prompts
    - You can literally give everything to AI — even its own instructions, config, and prompts for the next prompt, CLI debugging, devops infrastructure planning/debugging
    - The key is to automate the process pipeline as much as possible
    - Copy-paste-ready, context-aware planning
    - Group tasks logically in project management/planning software, like Trello or Notion
        - SHOW my Notion organization
    - Git commit message rules
    - I read most of the generated code, especially key decisions and file organization
        - But not black-box algorithms — for those, I create Vitest and e2e API tests
- Showcase the most complex things AI has built
    - Entire NoCode DataBuilder with multiple layouts, views, and filters
